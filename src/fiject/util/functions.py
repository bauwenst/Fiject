    Note that if the weights are not integers, the Bessel correction 1/(sum(w)-1) is no longer the correct factor that causes
    the estimator to be unbiased. Some say you should use 1/(sum(w)*(n-1)/n) as the correction factor, but this does NOT
    seem to be founded in the requirement that E[S^2] = E[(X - E[X])^2]. https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/6534/360389
