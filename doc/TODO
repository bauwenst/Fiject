TODO:
    - There should be a global switch to the effect of "ignore the caches and set everything and recompute everything".
      This would be for when you're debugging and you produced bad data on an IF_MISSING, and you don't want to go in to delete all those data.
    - Animations, i.e. stringing together commits into a multi-page PDF or a GIF.
    - Histogram is a subclass of MultiHistogram, but has some methods that are "more sophisticated" that should be
      integrated into MultiHistogram.
    - The JSON and PDF names are checked for availability independently, so JSON _0 can correspond to PDF _2 etc.
    - Tables:
         - Should be easy to drop rows (possibly you should be able to do this before committing though) to get a reduced table
         x Align &s
         x Deltas should be able to be coloured.
         x Multiplicative deltas
         x Fix bug that if a delta is the maximum/minimum, it is not bolded.
         x Fix bug that non-deltas are given a cell prefix/suffix.
