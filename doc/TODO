TODO:
    - Histogram is a subclass of MultiHistogram, but has some methods that are "more sophisticated" that should be
      integrated into MultiHistogram.
    - The JSON and PDF names are checked for availability independently, so JSON _0 can correspond to PDF _2 etc.
    - Tables:
         - Should be easy to drop rows (possibly you should be able to do this before committing though) to get a reduced table
         - Align &s
         - Deltas should be able to be coloured. That's a LaTeX issue, though.
    - If people are going to be using this script as a library, they need a way to set up the output path (and the scale too, while we're at it).
      Probably do it like logging does it.
